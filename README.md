# CupcakeX
A hobby project developed by me!

# What is it anyway?
CupcakeX is a hobby project developed by me using ForgeScript as the primary focus on development! It aims to be unique in such a way and to express my real think on what i actually want to add to my projects but think that it's just not worth it or when i don't have ideas and want to try something new. The project can also change the current displayed name across the commands thus allowing the bot to be in disguise easily as any other bot project such as Dodo-Bot.

# A bit of a history
Ever, since the beginning of me developing bots using aoi.js, it felt like there's no clear goal as to how to achieve a bugfree bots and most of the time, they would be eventually broken or become unstable one after the other in such a short period of time to be exact. It was all in an repeating cycle with no exit being ever found around the cycle. Askers, Epik-man and any private project never had a chance to be stable for months sadly!

Despite the fate of many of my aoi projects however, i couldn't give up yet! Dodo-Bot despite having a lot of bugs being fixed with each release, it still couldn't handle the frequent breaking changes of aoi.js which introduced new stuff with the exchange of more bugs which caused the bot to be barely stable at times and thus `$djsEval` using packages to achieve certain stuff inevitably breaking....

On one hand, you understand on why aoi.js has to be like this while on the other hand, you're very annoyed and generally being tired of each new version introducing bugs to you. Breaking changes exist for a good reason but having one after another is just pretty annoying imo and leaves you in a worrying state regarding your aoi project's stabilities to be honest however. The experiment of creating a bot project without aoi sparked such a interest in my mind and thus the idea of CupcakeX was born!

# FAQ
### What does this project mean as an hobby?
Compared to other projects, it is basically no goal but to add whatever i think of and experiment with stuff that could be potentially implemented in other projects like Dodo-Bot. 

It is unrecommended to have high expectations for the project personally but suggestions are very welcome there on what you think should be added to the project! It's all fun and cozy time learning something new until i return back to focus on an update of Dodo-Bot.

### If this is going to be used as an hobby project then why you didn't just stick with aoi.js?
I have lost my taste for creating any new aoi.js bots since they're going to have their commands break later. It's such tiring to keep an eye on them since there's no eta on whenever a new version of aoi.js releases leaving a false sense of relief only for your development to be nuked with a new version that has breaking changes!

Also i need to remind you that this is me being an open minded person so i like to try new stuff hence why i chose ForgeScript in case if you're wondering by the way!

### From what i understand, are you saying that aoi.js is terrible?
Absolutely no, everything has it's own limits if you accept the reality similar as to how in BDFD, you suffer with a bunch of limits compared to aoi. If aoi.js works the best for you then go with it and don't change your mind because somebody had different opinion that sounded like it made sense to you or so. 

I still believe aoi.js is great and newbies coming from BDFD should give it a try! After all, this is just my experience with aoi.js v6 and it may vary for you. If you have hard time understanding aoi.js then at least try to get used to it and understand it's syntax and if you have issues that you just need to find a easier alternative then you can give ForgeScript a try but take my answer with a grain of salt as this is my personal opinion in this case then...


### Bro??? Forgescript is a copy of aoi.js?????
First, take time thinking about what you just said:

"Why are there packages inspired by BDFD, not just aoi.js??"
"Is a package being inspired by BDFD a rip off?"
"How each package are similar but different to aoi?"

In other words, don't bother blaming any inspired package to be an copy of aoi.js when it isn't. Take a example of the package Hytescript.js where you can mistake it for being a rip off of aoi.js but if you actually take a closer look at the source code and see on how it works with it's respective functions then you can see that it's not a rip off but inspired by BDFD. 

Not everything IS A COPY OF AOI.JS! While yes being original is a nice thing, however, you don't have to be an ultra big brain developer to attempt having a 100% original package as what you're going to attempt experimenting with in this scenario has been also done by previous developers MILLION TIMES! It makes no sense to trash talk on an innocent package in this case.

If you aren't convinced then what if i told you that everyone has it's own ideas and they want to see their creation being brought to real life? That's how aoi.js appeared and the other BDFD-inspired packages! Trying to trash talk about those is like the equivalent of you thinking that you're doing the right thing when in reality, you did not. 

We may be all similar with functions and how our client setups look but that isn't an excuse that you're allowed to trash talk about those developer's creations or even it's users. After all, it's fine to try what previous devs have done hence why it's ok to add `$[]` to your package!

If you're going to try an inspired BDFD package other than aoi.js then i heavily advise you to wake up from your mind and don't make a pointless comparison between every single package for no reason. It's weird doing that and you're not doing anything useful with it by now then. Actually giving them a try leads you to learn about new stuff and even like using them if you ever enjoyed those! This is a reason on why you should generally accept other users regardless of how their stuff works!
